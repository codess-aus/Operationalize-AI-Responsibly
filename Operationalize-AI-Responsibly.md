# Operationalize AI Responsibly

Developers should aim to build a repeatable, systematic process to ensure consistency at scale.

## Governance
Establish policies, practices, and processes that align with Microsoft's Responsible AI Standard. 
It includes embedding AI principles into the development lifecycle and workflows to comply with laws and regulations across privacy, security, and responsible AI.

## Map
Potential risks are identified and prioritized. 
This includes conducting impact assessments, security threat modeling, and red teaming to understand the implications of the AI system on people, organizations, and society.

## Measure
The frequency and severity of potential harms are measured using clear metrics, test sets, and systematic testing. 
This helps in understanding the trade-offs between different kinds of errors and experiences.

## Mitigate
Mitigations are implemented using strategies like prompt engineering, grounding, and content filters. 
The effectiveness of these mitigations is then tested through manual and automated evaluations.

## Operate
Define and execute a deployment and operational readiness plan, setup monitoring, and improve the AI application in production through monitoring and incident response.
